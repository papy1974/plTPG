Installation
To run the project, user have to install inquirer in your commande prompt, and jest for testing. 

Description
The project is about writing code to use inquirer to gather information about the development team members,
and to create objects for each team member (using the correct classes as blueprints!).
After the user has input all employees desired, call the `htmltemp.js` function (required
above) and pass in an array containing all employee objects; the `htmltemp` function will
generate and return a block of HTML including templated divs for each employee!
​
After you have your html, you're now ready to create an HTML file using the HTML
returned from the `htmltemp` function. Now write it to a file named `team.html` in the
output` folder. You can use the variable `outputPath` above target this location.
is structure will be crucial in order
for the provided `htmltemp` function to work!


Instructions

To install inquirer, type npm install from your commande prompte or directory , npm test for testing the program.
